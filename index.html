<h2> About Us </h2>
<p> It all started 12 years ago. A fusion of creativity, talent and skill is what Ordin@trix is all about. Ordin@trix has evolved through the years moving from an interschool festival at the state level to an international event. Over the years we have had students from China, Muscat, Japan and other countries as regular participants.</p>

<p>The event has witnessed gracious presence of celebrities like Mr. Amol Gupte and Miss Manju Singh apart from experts from various technical fields. The movies showcased here have been screened at the movie festivals by PVR Cinemas and CHINH India Festival. </p>
